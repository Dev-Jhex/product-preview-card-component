## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
In this project I learned that is good to make the right decisions of what techniques you are going to use before coding the project at all. For me in particular i used grid for this one just because i thought it would be better for switching the image and the info side yet but if i thought well i would also consider using flex for that and to be honest I got a hard time with Grid since I was not that comfortable with it yet, so make the right decisions and really think before you dive into your code.
